Still Need Full Implementation (BASED ON diet_classifiers_original.py):

features/text.py - TF-IDF vectorization
features/images.py - Image downloading and embeddings
models/training.py - run_mode_A function
models/tuning.py - Hyperparameter tuning
ensembles/ - All ensemble modules
evaluation/visualization.py - Plotting functions
evaluation/export.py - CSV export functions
pipeline/orchestrator.py - Full implementation (currently stub)

Implement the remaining modules following the same patterns
